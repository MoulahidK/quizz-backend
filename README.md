## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

- [Maven 3.6.3](https://maven.apache.org)
## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `QuizzBackendApplication` class from your IDE.
Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:
